// This is a basic file used to learn more about functions. The thing is: imput a number and find its summatory. Then use the result of the
// summatory to find the half of its result.

// I thought about using another function to get the input, but it would be more complicated because there would be too much functions
// one for welcome, ask the input, find the sum and find the half.

// In the case of a easy code like this, using functions just made the program harder to understand. Too much things for something simple
// Functions are very good for long codes or tasks that need the same command multiple times. This wasn't the case, so this program is just 
// for learning.
